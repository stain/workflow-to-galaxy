== Synopsis

This script requires a Taverna2 workflow URL as input and generates a Galaxy tool
(a UI XML definition plus a script) that will enable the execution of this
workflow through Galaxy. The tool's description is as good as the description
provided in the workflow itself. Currently, the myExperiment workflow repository
is used to access workflow information via its REST API but a workflow description
from a file is also supported.

The name is workflow-to-galaxy rather than t2-workflow-to-galaxy because it is
possible that it will support other workflow management systems in the future.


== Installation

  [sudo] gem install workflow-to-galaxy


== Usage

workflow_to_galaxy [options] <myExperiement-workflow> | <t2flow-file>

Generates a Galaxy tool (a UI xml definition plus a script) for the
specified Taverna2 workflow, where <myExperiment-workflow> is
the full URL of the workflow in the myExperiment website. Alternatively
a t2flow file can be passed for workflows not in myExperiment. Available
options are:

  -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT  The file name(s) of the generated tool. If it is not specified then the workflow's name will be used.

  -s SERVER, --server=SERVER  The taverna server that the script will request execution from. If it is not specified then "http://localhost:8980/taverna-server" will be used.

  -t,        --t2flow         The workflow is a t2flow file.


== Example

Let's say we want to install the taverna2 workflow http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/74.html
from myExperiment repository:

  $ workflow_to_galaxy  -s http://localhost:8980/taverna-server  http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/74/download/bioaid_proteindiscovery_781733.t2flow?version=5
