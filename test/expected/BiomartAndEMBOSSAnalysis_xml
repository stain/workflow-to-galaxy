**What it does**

This workflow retrieves all genes on human chromosome 22 that are associated with a disease and aligns the upstream regions with mouse and rat homologues. The alignments are plotted and corresponding sequence ids are also returned.Using Biomart and EMBOSS soaplab services, This workflow retrieves a number of sequences from 3 species: mouse, human, rat; align them, and returns a plot of the alignment result. Corresponding sequence ids are also returned.

**Please note that some workflows are not up-to-date or have dependencies** that cannot be met by the specific Taverna server that you specified during generation of this tool. You can make sure that the workflow is valid by running it in the Taverna Workbench first to confirm that it works before running it via Galaxy.

**Please note that there might be some repetitions in the workflow description** in some of the generated workflows. This is due to a backwards compatibility issue on the myExperiment repository which keeps the old descriptions to make sure that no information is lost.
